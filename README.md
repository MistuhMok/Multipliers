## Multipliers
• The project displays a table of numbers in order. By default, the table has width and height of 10, showing the numbers from 1 to 100.

• The user can specify the table’s width and height. The width and height
determine the range of numbers displayed; i.e. if the width was 15 and the
height was 20, the table will display the numbers 1 to 300 in rows of 15.
The table changes immediately with any changes to the user’s input.

• Additionally, the user is able to input “multipliers”, that would
cause all multiples of the “multiplier” in the table to be highlighted in some
color.

• The user can input multiple “multipliers”. There is a button labeled
“Add multiplier” which will insert a new input box onto the screen. There
 is an “x” button to delete multipliers, and remove the input box.

• Each multiplier is marked with a separate color, and the multiples
of each multiplier are highlighted with the specified color.
